#|This file contains a model of a board, which contains all of the state
of a Santorini game in a single snapshot. A board knows about:
- the spaces of the game's grid
- the position of the players' tokens
- which player's turn it is
- the position and level of each tower.
- the total number of elapsed turns since the start of the game. |#
